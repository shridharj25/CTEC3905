# CTEC3905 Assignment
## P17178463
### Shridhar Jentilal

- To do this assignment, I made use of varies different links, these links were primarily from  https://www.w3schools.com. I also made use of the work from the labs, on my website,

-Making use of ul and li for my nav bar really helped me with creating a more "controlled" navbar.

# index.html(HomePage)
 This is the main Page of my website, the HomePage

- In my HomePage, I made use of the slideshow gallery to display the images of three movies, after 5 seconds.  [SLIDESHOW GALLERY](https://https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp). This Link has the code that I have used to achieve this, but, I had to modify it in a way where the slideshow gallery changes the images automatically as suppose to when the user clicks on the image.

 - The logo was created using a online logo creator [Logo](https://www.tailorbrands.com/)

 - The HomePage also has a type writer animation. I learnt this code from [TypeWriter](https://css-tricks.com/books/fundamental-css-tactics/animate-text-like-typewriter/)

# movies.html(Movies)

-My movies page has the API which I managed to create using mixture of codes from [API1](https://codepen.io/rogergcc/pen/ZvVgOG) [AP2](https://codepen.io/ach-men/pen/zjEWxq). This was the hardest part of the website creation, as it required an API Key

-API key was requested from [APIKEY](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to gain access to the database

# tvnews.html(TVNews)

In this page, I made use of a table like format for the tv shows. In the tablet view, the grid comes together and goes down in a list presentation. I used the [Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_list_grid_view.asp) To get the code for how the grid would be laid out.


# contactus.html(Contact Us)

Contains a user form, to allow people to submit a query. I used [Contact Form](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp) To achieve this.

# Issues
- initially I had trouble with removing the "onclick" from the html and use the js. But, even after 2 days of work, It was not successful. Instead, I changed the need of having a previous and next button into a automatic change

- Getting the grid/table to format itself properly on the tv news page, was proven to be quite difficult. This is because, I had the issue where not only the image sizes were different but also the boxes where the text is written. This only was the case in the tablet view. But, After some research in the w3schools website, [Table Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) was able to conjure up a relatively decent grid with images and text.


# JavaScript

- I have three javascripts. The first two are responsible for the menu button 'onclick' function on the four pages. It also has the JS for the automatic slideshow.



The `js/scripts.js` file contains a simple console.log statement to confirm that it is being executed.

```
console.log("hello");
```
